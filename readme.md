# Stitch Mobile Example - Todo App

This sample app is intended to be used by following the 
[Todo tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-overview/) in the 
Stitch docs. It demonstrates the process of building an 
iOS app that connects to the Stitch backend and uses Atlas for data storage. 

We also have [Android](https://github.com/mongodb-university/stitch-tutorial-todo-android) 
and [Web (React)](https://github.com/mongodb-university/stitch-tutorial-todo-web) 
versions.

An example of Google OAuth is including in the
[google-oauth](https://github.com/mongodb-university/stitch-tutorial-todo-ios/tree/google-oauth)
branch.
